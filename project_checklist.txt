[x] 1. Environment setup (requirements.txt, folder structure)
[x] 2. Download StyleGAN2 weights (FFHQ .pkl and .pt)
[x] 3. Use precomputed latents/boundaries for editing
[x] 4. Refactor code for CPU fallback (patch CUDA extension loading)
[x] 5. Resolve persistent Windows/Python/conda version conflicts (pipeline testing blocked)
[x] 6. Test encode real face pipeline (once environment is stable)
[x] 7. Implement latent space manipulation (edit attributes)
[x] 8. Reconstruct and show before/after
[ ] 9. Build unified webapp UI for user uploads, edits, and model selection (StyleGAN2, Diffusion, LoRA)
[ ] 10. Integrate Stable Diffusion model for advanced editing
[ ] 11. Add LoRA support for efficient fine-tuning (for StyleGAN2 and Diffusion)
[ ] 12. (Optional) Add custom loss functions, evaluation metrics, fairness notes
